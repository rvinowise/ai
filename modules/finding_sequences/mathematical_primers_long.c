// 1. realise that +=;ok; is a figure
// 2. realise that we are standing in front of part of that figure +=
// 3. try to complete the figure as constant +=;ok;
// that won't succeed because of the importance of context
// 4. turn the figure +=;ok; into an algorithm with context 
// [digit 1]+[digit 2]=[digit 3];ok;
// 5. solve the algorithm [digit 1] & [digit 2] -> [digit 3] 
// (this is one of many possible related lgorithms)
